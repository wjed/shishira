                <span class="dropcap">T</span>here's no decision greater than what gas station you pledge your allegiance to. It can make or break any road trip, no matter the length. Even with the recent addition of Buc-ee's to our lovely town, the debate still remains as strong as ever: Sheetz or Wawa?
            </p>
            
            <p>With the new Wawa having opened in Elkton, I knew I had to get to the bottom of this plaguing issue. To help me break this down, I asked sophomore nursing major Tierney Ciaverelli, a girl from the North who found herself among the rest of us. Ciaverelli is New York-born, but Richmond raised (mostly), and she attended Fairfield University in Connecticut before transferring here for her sophomore year.</p>
            
            <p>I feel like hometowns play a part in the gas station partiality, so when I met Ciaverelli, a unique case, I knew I was in for a treat — my very own unicorn, if you will. When I asked her preference, it took not even a second for her to stare me in my eyes and spoke her truth: "Wawa." It was like a declaration of utmost faith. The look in her eyes was that of a soldier ready to charge into war, or maybe a really protective lioness or something. You get what I mean.</p>
            
            <p>A part of me was ready to surrender to her, but as the serious and intimidating writer I am, I stayed strong. "Sheetz just simply does not exist where I'm from," Ciaverelli said. So it's valid that she leans towards Wawa — it's all she's ever known! Her usual order is a turkey sub and a pretzel with a Diet Coke — so obviously, we're dealing with a high-class woman. Hard to beat a nearly perfect order, but I think Sheetz has enough to combat it — have you even had the mac and cheese bites? The App Sampler?</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"In all honesty, my criteria for what makes a 'good' or 'better' gas station is one thing and one thing only: the Good Ice."</blockquote>
            </div>
            
            <p>If an establishment does not offer the Good Ice, consider it over. A customer lost. A heart broken. For those who are unfamiliar with the Good Ice (which hurts my soul a little bit but), it's essentially little nuggets of ice rather than the cubes we are usually subject to. Think Chick-fil-A ice or sometimes, if you're lucky, Starbucks refresher ice (I literally take all the fruit pieces out when I'm done and eat all the ice. Is that concerning or?).</p>
            
            <p>Luckily for me, both of these monument-adjacent places have the Good Ice, which makes my life both easier and harder. And yet, with both places having the Good Ice, personally, my heart beats for Sheetz. Sue me!</p>
            
            <p>More events in my life can be marked by visits to Sheetz than anything else — this summer, right by my internship office in Richmond, there was a Sheetz. When I could feel that 1 to 3 p.m. slump lurching around the corner, I would treat myself to a Coke Zero. It was perfect. This year, my apartment is right by the Sheetz, and I have gotten more slushies than I deserve, probably, but that's none of my business. It's too easy!</p>
            
            <p>A part of me does wonder how the new Wawa here in Rockingham County will change things. Will the line at Buc-ee's suddenly become shorter? I can almost guarantee the answer is still no, but a girl can certainly dream. Why am I waiting 19,948,239,483 minutes for a brisket sandwich? Anyway. I digress.</p>
            
            <p>Will the first thought for a treat become Wawa and not my usual slushie and App Sampler at Sheetz? As if I would betray my beloved, but maybe Ciaverelli is onto something. "Even though I grew up with Wawa and not Sheetz, I just feel like the food is so much better at Wawa than Sheetz," Ciaverelli said.</p>
            
            <p>A part of me wonders: Has she ever even had Sheetz chicken nuggets? I understand Hoagiefest is supposed to be lit, but, like, Sheetz is a party every day? This might just remain a question that goes unanswered.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the day, as long as you have your place to get your late-night treat, that's all that matters. Life is short! Get a slushie or a turkey sub or a mac and cheese bite, or maybe all of the above! I support you no matter what. You are loved in Sheetz or Wawa or Buc-ee's or even 7-Eleven if you get down like that.</p>
