                <span class="dropcap">I</span>'m a movie buff. There, I said it. My secret is out! And when it comes to movies, I tend to have quite strong opinions — whether it be the acting or the music, I have thoughts. However, recently, I've stumbled upon some news that has me questioning everything — the casting for the new Beatles biopic.
            </p>
            
            <p>In case you haven't heard/seen/witnessed the aftermath (caused all because of me), it was recently announced that in April 2028, director Sam Mendes will release a series of four films, each one surrounding a different Beatles member. The cast? I thought you'd never ask: Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison.</p>
            
            <p>I would just like to mention that when I encountered this information on Instagram, someone genuinely commented: "was the casting director an 18-year-old ovulating girl?" Someone was so confused that they took the time to type that out on a news source. And the worst part? I kind of agree.</p>
            
            <p>Now, don't get me wrong — do I love me some Paul Mescal? Absolutely. I'm not dead inside. But you have to admit, the resemblance is whatever the opposite of uncanny is. Canny? So canny. Paul and other Paul, I guess, do not bear any similarities in my eyes. I will admit my vision isn't the greatest, but still, I'm not blind.</p>
            
            <p>I can also admit that it's not like every celebrity who stars in a biopic is identical to the person they're playing, like Jennifer Lopez in "Selena." Though they weren't carbon copies, you have to admit they have a slight resemblance. The case for these bad boys is not the same.</p>
            
            <p>Again, no hate towards these actors or anyone! I just hate movies that are obviously a cash grab — they took the hottest actors (figuratively and literally) and put them in a movie. And for what? All I'm saying is I would need more than Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to make it make sense to me.</p>
            
            <p>I would never discount their acting abilities, though. I've seen the work of each actor before, and I don't doubt that there will be a great performance on their part. I mean, come on. Chrissy, wake up?! A masterpiece. "Normal People?" Breathtaking. "The Banshees of Inisherin?" Perfection. "Babygirl?" … Actually, never mind. I don't really do milk like that.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, you get what I'm saying. When it comes to the quality of their work, I don't doubt that they'll kill it. Will watching it kill me in the process? Maybe.</p>
            
            <p>To see if I was alone in this, I spoke to rising sophomore Holly Jahn, a member of JMU's Cinemuse Film Club (and Breeze TV's floor director).</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"I think they wanted four hot, European actors with some popularity. Perhaps they want to capture what the Beatles had with their female fans, and how crazy those fans were by getting 'white boys of the month.' But who knows, maybe they have talent."</blockquote>
                <cite>— Holly Jahn, JMU Cinemuse Film Club</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>She has much more faith than I do. Jahn does agree that the boys bear no similarity to the Beatles.</p>
            
            <p>"There have been good prosthetics used in the past to make an actor look similar [to their role], but it gets to a point where it just becomes a game to the audience to point those out, like Rami Malik and his teeth in 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' it becomes a joke," Jahn said.</p>
            
            <p>The movie hasn't even come out yet, and because of this casting, I am already docking its points — it's become a joke, at least to me.</p>
            
            <p>"I think they are all good actors, but I haven't seen any of them sing or portray a real person, so I am just not sure that casting based on name was the right move here," Jahn said.</p>
            
            <p>And she's not wrong at all — it wasn't a good move. If there's a shirtless scene, then I will stand up in the movie theater and clap (I promise I'm not objectifying them. Unless you're into that, then I am). But if these movies are supposed to be something substantial, then we're already off on the wrong foot.</p>
            
            <p>Jahn and I agree on something else as well — "None of them are going to look good in the bowl cut."</p>
            
            <p>In order to be a good movie critic (a.k.a. to log it in Letterboxd), you have to remain open-minded and unbiased. When April 2028 comes around, I will scan my Regal Unlimited, grab a small popcorn and Diet Pepsi and I'll sit through this movie. I'll try to remember that Eddie from "Stranger Things" is supposed to be one of the greatest musicians of all time, and I will be as positive as possible.</p>
            
            <p>And who knows! Maybe the music will be good and I'll sing along and all will be well. Or I'll walk out and pretend I'm on Abbey Road as I try not to cringe my eyes out. I guess art is subjective for a reason. See you in the theaters!</p>
