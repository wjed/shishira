                <span class="dropcap">W</span>hen I arrived at college, I assumed coming here was the great, big thing we were all trying to do. I figured picking a college, and then a major was the hard part, so we must be one step closer to our dreams coming true. What a thing to celebrate!
            </p>
            
            <p>As the second semester of my first year of school comes to an end, I realized something: Some people think their struggle is worse than others. Allow me to explain. What I mean is, I've encountered this sort of "one-upping" of trauma, if you will. In the academic sense, this idea that one person's major is "harder" than someone else's was unbelievable to me — I mean, I thought the thing that united us was that we struggled together, but apparently, it's a competition, and I'm probably already losing!</p>
            
            <p>I've noticed this mindset the most from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors toward any liberal arts student, actually (please don't pull my life support plug out when I'm not looking. I swear it's not a diss). From these students, I hear comments like, "SMAD (media arts and design) isn't even a real major," or "What even is a communications major?"</p>
            
            <p>People seem to think that anyone who isn't in a science or math-related field has it "easier," but I beg to differ — that's not to discount any of the work those students do, you guys are brilliant. But your genius doesn't take away from anyone else's — I believe being able to put a laptop together or sew an arm back on is just as important as any of the work someone with a SMAD major might do.</p>
            
            <p>To explore this feeling and sentiment that cannot be denied, I wanted an educator's perspective, then the educated, if you will. I interviewed SMAD professor Ryan Alessi, or just Alessi by those who know him, for his thoughts on the matter.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"[SMAD is] helping us figure out what it is to be human, to understand the society and the earth around us and all that it entails. Our SMAD majors are multimedia storytellers, and what that means is they are all focusing on not only how to tell a story in a compelling, meaningful, accurate way, authentic way, but also doing that in different media."</blockquote>
                <cite>— Ryan Alessi, SMAD Professor</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>A common comment chucked toward SMAD students wrapped in barbed wire and insecurity is that SMAD is "easy." While I took it as a challenge or insult (and I'm not even a SMAD major), Alessi saw it differently.</p>
            
            <p>"We have our own experiences, and we're most familiar with our experiences, and we know we're experts on how difficult the challenges are right in front of us as individuals, it's oftentimes difficult to understand what goes in to a different field, or what a different area requires people to know or skills to develop," Alessi said. "And probably the theme or the similarity that runs through all disciplines is that the people who are typically the best at that area, make their area look the easiest, and that's actually a compliment, I think."</p>
            
            <p>At SMAD's core is storytelling, as Alessi would put it, and yet, I believed there was still something more. That thing turned out to be humanity, but more specifically, perseverance.</p>
            
            <p>"[Students have] found that the skills and the knowledge that they cultivated [in school] translate [to] the ability to crack a problem or to have the fortitude to stick with a tough mathematical problem," Alessi said. "Developing those skills are no less or more important than the ones that you know our friends in math and science are doing."</p>
            
            <p>As Alessi said that, I was intrigued. The deeper you think about it, the clearer it becomes: Science and art are connected in many different ways, and I think the main thing they have in common is their reliance on asking questions.</p>
            
            <p>"I think questions are our most powerful tool, and that's what every major is exploring anyway, and the most cross-disciplinary thing we can do is ask questions about somebody else's area of expertise," Alessi said.</p>
            
            <p>I wanted another perspective on this "SMAD isn't real" epidemic, so I turned to senior SMAD and WRTC major, BriAnna Thweatt — who is also a former Breeze news writer.</p>
            
            <p>"You may just see me reading a story, [but] I have to go in here and analyze everything in the story to make sure I understand it, and then spit it back out in my own way," Thweatt said. "We have a lot of comprehension on our side that fuels us into what we do."</p>
            
            <p>Thweatt made an excellent point about where this perspective may stem from (no pun intended, unless you liked it like that.) "I think it comes from gen eds," Thweatt said. "We're missing half the population on campus not being able to experience [SMAD] classes, or these kinds of opportunities within these majors, and we're not presenting them in the right light."</p>
            
            <p>Like every STEM-related conversation, Grey's Anatomy became a topic, but not in the way you may think.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"We need these doctors and all these scientists to help us with the world, but at the same time, we need these journalists and advertisers and movie makers and web designers to be able to help those scientists, to be able to tell [their story] to the world."</blockquote>
                <cite>— BriAnna Thweatt, SMAD & WRTC Major</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>"We need shows like Grey's Anatomy to help pool entertainment to want to inspire a little girl or a little boy or whoever, to go into wanting to be a doctor or to inspire them to want to make a show about doctors, because that inspired them. I think it goes both ways that we kind of depend on each other, quite honestly," Thweatt said.</p>
            
            <p>We depend on each other. SMAD and STEM majors, no matter chemistry or cinema, because behind the major, we are all people. Friends, even. Ultimately, both majors help us determine what it means to be human, in more ways than one. Who is anyone to judge?</p>
            
            <p>Being here, going to class, putting yourself out there — this is the great, big thing! You even having a major is the impressive part. Science is an art, and art is a science, and personally, all of it is beautiful.</p>
