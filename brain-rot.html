                <span class="dropcap">R</span>emember that godforsaken day earlier this year when all hope, joy and will to live was lost? In case you're unfamiliar, I'm referring to Jan. 19 — the day TikTok was banned. Without the mindless scrolling, I was frozen — in withdrawal. Some might even say I was tweaking out.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, one thing persisted even in TikTok's death, and then resurrection: the brain rot. Now, I can handle a "sigma" or two, but what I can't stand and simply don't understand is how in this day and age, we're still making fat jokes; I hate any joke or comment with the word 'big-back' in it.</p>
            
            <p>In all honesty, it's just not funny to me. I've never heard "big-back" in any context and thought, "oh, yeah, that was the right thing to say." I cannot comprehend how TikTok — the app that normalized intuitive eating, destigmatized those Chloe Ting workouts we all secretly did in our bedrooms and taught us about treating ourselves — is the same app that's now making jokes about eating and food and body image?</p>
            
            <p>I know, you're probably reading this and thinking I'm taking this way too seriously, and you know what? I'm not. Jokes like this — about eating and food in general — especially at someone else's expense, are never funny. Even though it may be a TikTok trend, it can actually be extremely detrimental.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"The English language is a huge tool that we have, it's how we talk to each other, and express our emotions. It kind of gets tarnished with this brain rot, saying one thing when the actual word you're saying could [have] a completely different definition than it does on TikTok."</blockquote>

            </div>
            
            <p>My main complaint (other than the fact that it's just not funny) comes from the lack of emotional intelligence that is often hand in hand with the use of the term. "Our words hold weight," said Pezzullo. "You shouldn't be using them that way."</p>
            
            <p>We compared our experiences hearing words like "big-back" and "fatty" in the real world. For me, it's moments where I'm in the dining hall and it's time to head to the dish return. "Am I going to look like a fatty with all these plates?" I hear, as I'm struggling to carry the plates that I have. I glanced over — "all these plates" actually equated to two. Two plates. You had a proper meal, and now you're fat?</p>
            
            <p>Pezzullo related to the way that made her feel and shared her own moment of insecurity. "I'll see this girl post what she ate in a day and the comments will be like 'she's a fat whale,'" she said. "I was like, wait, this is a meal I would actually like to eat."</p>
            
            <p>Just because something is on TikTok doesn't mean it's acceptable, or even remotely funny in the real world. More often than not, there's some new fad or obsession TikTok needs you to run — not walk — to buy, because it will cure all your problems. That problem? Usually, that problem is you looking a certain way.</p>
            
            <p>We're told our guts are unhealthy and we need a magical probiotic soda to make all our troubles go away. How do you know my gut is unhealthy? I think my gut and I are perfectly fine, thank you very much.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"I think there's something to be said about [companies] benefiting from our lack of information. Because all they're doing is taking the food you already have, blending it up, they're putting it in a cute package, and they're saying it's gonna [be] life changing, like [some] groundbreaking technology."</blockquote>
                <cite>— Sam Pezzullo</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>No amount of special coconut yogurt will fix you, like some magical ingredient you've been missing all your life. Because the truth is, you might've never had a problem in the first place; the media just made you think that.</p>
            
            <p>"It's about little victories," Pezzullo said. "There should be no nagging voice in the back of your head [saying] that 'I shouldn't allow myself to this little victory [like a sweet treat], because at the end of the day, we [would] be blessed to have a relationship with food where I feel okay allowing myself to have a scoop of ice cream."</p>
            
            <p>This sentiment is important to echo. Your life, your body, your feelings — all of these things are completely your own, and no one else has any right to any of it. You deserve to have everything you want, and your physical appearance doesn't impact that. No amount of food makes you any less deserving of joy.</p>
            
            <p>"[Healthiness] isn't like a 'one size fits all' situation," Pezzullo said. "It requires trial and error, and everyone finding out what works for them."</p>
            
            <p>Because two plates at D-Hall works for me, and if you're learning that that works for you, too, that's ok. Because you aren't a "fatty" for wanting dessert after a burrito bowl. Because you don't have to exercise to "deserve" anything. If TikTok may not remind you, let me remind you in this form of media that you're enough.</p>
