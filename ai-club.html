                <span class="dropcap">J</span>MU is home to over 400 clubs, and now, a new one is added to the list: the Madison Artificial Intelligence Club (MAIC), founded by senior Mason Scofield earlier this year, which is a space for students with interest in anything AI to come together and learn, explore and dive deep into the world of AI technology.
            </p>
            
            <p>Scofield — a computer science major with robotics, computer information systems (CIS) and integrated science and technology (ISAT) minors — described the club as "an opportunity to build a community where students could come as they are, learn AI [and] collaborate across industries."</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"MAIC, or the Madison Artificial Intelligence Club, is JMU's first community for learning, experimenting, connecting and teaching all things artificial intelligence. In the world of AI, [MAIC] is a group of people looking to catapult each other forward in learning and develop personal and professional connections that will last long after college."</blockquote>
                <cite>— Mason Scofield, MAIC Founder</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>MAIC is a place for hackathons, panels, and discussions on AI and its future. Interestingly enough, Scofield said the club came about in an unorthodox way.</p>
            
            <p>"It happened almost by accident. It was only in passing that my friend told me he was on the way to the first constitution writing meeting, and I half-jokingly asked to tag along," Scofield said. "What started as a spontaneous decision quickly became something bigger."</p>
            
            <p>Scofield and his team of co-founders saw a need for a space to navigate their own curriculum and the real world, and MAIC became that for them.</p>
            
            <p>"We want to bridge the gap between classes and the real world," Scofield said. "When I first joined the early conversations about MAIC, I quickly realized how necessary something like this was." He added that, although he didn't come up with the idea himself, it was evident to him that there was a big demand for a club where students could get hands-on experience with AI.</p>
            
            <p>The club has a unique application-based process and a committee system where members work together to build projects in their "field of application." The club also hosts speaker events, conferences, and panels to provide a clearer insight into the AI industry.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"To me, the Madison Artificial Intelligence Club isn't just a place to learn or build skills. It represents opportunity. MAIC is about creating access for those who care, not just those with experience. I want this club to be a place people look back on fondly, and think 'I wouldn't be where I am without MAIC.'"</blockquote>

            </div>
            
            <p>What Scofield and his team have put together is an inclusive, curiosity-cultivating environment for students and peers alike who just want to learn more about the changing world.</p>
            
            <p>"My favorite part so far has been seeing how much excitement and support MAIC has received from every direction. Students, faculty and even professionals in the AI and tech industry want to come together to teach and learn from each other," Scofield said. "It's been incredible to watch what started as an idea turn into a community with momentum that people believe in."</p>
            
            <p>"I believe what we are building matters, not just for us, but for the future of learners and aspiring professionals at JMU," Scofield concluded.</p>
