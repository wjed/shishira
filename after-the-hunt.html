                <span class="dropcap">A</span> ticking sound. Rustling bedsheets. The sound of a brush running through hair. More ticking. This is how Luca Guadagnino's "After the Hunt" begins. The film — starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield, alongside numerous other dazzling names — centers on Alma (Roberts) and her relationships, personal and professional, with Maggie (Edebiri) and Hank (Garfield).
            </p>
            
            <p>When Maggie approaches Alma about a traumatizing incident with Hank, Alma navigates the situation, battling both her head and heart. She is forced to choose between playing the role of friend or colleague to both Maggie and Hank, and the aftermath is brutal. From courtroom to classroom, the tension between these characters and Alma is riveting.</p>
            
            <p>The music is haunting, featuring a song by The National and instrumental pieces that travel into the sinews of your heart. It furrows much like the feeling throughout this movie, like something awful is simply bound to happen. Call it anxiety, fear or maybe cruel anticipation.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>"It's not true, Alma. It's not true."</blockquote>
            </div>
            
            <p>How far does charm take someone? How far can it truly go? There is a scene where Garfield and Roberts dine at his usual place — an Indian restaurant (if I didn't have popcorn with me, I would have been clawing at that screen out of desperation). As Garfield tears into tandoori chicken and squishes around saag paneer, the aura that once surrounded the smooth-talking professor turns from magic to manipulative.</p>
            
            <p>"It's going to be her word against a lifetime of hard work." He wields the "I had no choice" card like a pitchfork lit on fire and my stomach churned as I wondered if it would work on Alma.</p>
            
            <p>It's interesting to me — the switch of a charming character when they need to be believed versus when everyone believes in them. What are you defending, I wonder. Your ego? This thought butted into my brain many, many times as I watched the film. Garfield's reaction to being called out is painfully real — a frantic reaching for things to claim as his truth.</p>
            
            <p>"It would mean a lot if I had your support." When Maggie says this, I feel this is when Alma has the most fear in her eyes. Her sincerity is shaky. She tells Maggie that she believes her, but it sounds like Alma is convincing herself.</p>
            
            <p>"You did this to yourself," Alma says to Hank, and he literally threw a tantrum. Yay men! I mean, seriously, his belittlement of the women in this film is unsettling. I mean, wow.</p>
            
            <p>"If it's real to you, it's real," Alma says to Maggie, and yet, lashes out at her like waves that can't decide whether to come in or pull away. There is a tension that is thin but sturdy. Cannot be denied.</p>
            
            <p>The film is a mad dash between the concept of belief and begging to be seen. It's unsettling and uncomfortable, but ultimately, beautiful. The dialogue is scathing and raw. This movie holds a mirror up to society and how we navigate the concept of a victim.</p>
            
            <p>There were countless discussions of "what would people think," and so on, and I think it absolutely can be found in real life. I think what it means to "know" is also battled here. There are many assumptions made here, of course, and many of them are believed. What makes one person more believable than the other?</p>
            
            <p>Overall, aside from the somewhat occasional strange clashes of music, I think this movie is worth a watch. A solid four out of five stars. It challenges the mind, and it helps that Garfield makes a sexy professor. And of philosophy, which means he says all sorts of smart stuff, and I am just nodding and agreeing. His English accent peeks through sometimes, and it helps. He is an awful person in the movie, though.</p>
            
            <p>Roberts, by the way? Stunning. Incredible.</p>
