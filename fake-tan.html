                <span class="dropcap">W</span>hen a beautiful woman walks past me, I might notice a few things: the smell of her hair oil wafting toward me, her pink sugar glossed lips curving into the most dazzling smile, the intelligence sewn into her every laugh and dialogue. Never once have I looked at a person and thought, "They're too pale."
            </p>
            
            <p>Maybe it's because I don't really need it — #imapersonofcolor — but I've just never been able to understand the appeal or urgency behind fake tans. If it makes you feel more confident, then by all means. But I think we would be wrong not to dig deeper and ask why — why does this bronze elixir have such a hold on the world? Who decided tan equals beauty?</p>
            
            <p>My issue comes from more of a societal standpoint: why is a tan woman the ideal when there is still a large presence of colorism in the beauty industry? I find it curious that white women who falsely darken themselves can be marketed as and believed to be more attractive than women of darker skin tones. If you're going to continue the standard that a fake tan is prettier than a natural skin tone, then at least have the decency to include truly brown-skinned women in the same way. It's only fair.</p>
            
            <p>Women of color have been excluded and disgraced from the beauty and modeling industry for years, and it baffles me that while this happens, white women are getting spray tans so intense it turns them into a different race. The satisfaction behind being borderline orange both confuses and concerns me.</p>
            
            <p>I would like to follow up and say that I have no issue with anyone who chooses to fake tan; my problem is with this idea that being tan — whether in 90 or 20-degree weather — makes someone more attractive. You're beautiful, whether "pale" or not.</p>
            
            <p>It's not fair to people who are naturally tan because of their race and ethnicity. People of a deeper complexion have faced colorist mindsets for ages, but instead of the world welcoming and encouraging their skin tone, they're offered skin-lightening products. Because their skin is too dark to be seen as beautiful, and a lighter complexion is made the definition of beauty.</p>
            
            <p>Yet I look at girls who fit this ideal and see the discoloration on their hands, like a great divide of bronze and cream — like a really screwed-up Oreo.</p>
            
            <p>The moral of the story is no matter what shade you are, you're someone's image of perfect. There's no need to be trying to change yourself for an ideal that doesn't exist. You're perfect just the way you are! No amount of Tanologist or St. Tropez or purposefully not wearing sunscreen will change who you really are, so embrace it.</p>
            
            <p>Personally, whether you look like the Oscar statuette or think you blend into paper, I see nothing but the way you laugh, your favorite songs, the way you love your friends and the fact that you're kind and important. So put down the fake tanner, pick up a mirror and realize how gorgeous you are.</p>
